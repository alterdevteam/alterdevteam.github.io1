## Introduction

Alter is a Trezor alternative, powered by a recently awarded “Digital Public Goods Alliance” by UNICEF, Fedora Linux 35 (an open source operating sys-
tem based on Linux kernel) and other third party components, complimented manually written software.

The primary goal of Alter is to decrease the risks of being hacked, and provide a secure and private container for the user data, for people who doesn't have time to deal with every setups needed to do, through the use of an open source software, whereas the user can review the source code, thus being able modify it based on their preference.

However, despite all the modification, Alter is not a hack proof device, it still can be hacked, especially on the internet, depending from the client side, as once it was handled to the client, the device is fully modifiable upto a degree where it can lose all its security or secure it to a degree where it is unusable.
